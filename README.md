## Description

The code consists of a simple table form that allows users to input data for an individual. It includes four input fields for ID, name, profession, and address,
and a button to add the data to the table.

The JavaScript code handles the process of adding data to the table when the "Add Data" button is clicked. It retrieves the values from the input fields,
creates a new row in the table, and appends the data to the table.

Additionally, each row of the table has two buttons: "Delete" and "Update." The "Delete" button removes the corresponding row from the table when clicked,
and the "Update" button will log a message to the console indicating that it has been clicked.
